Study the following items from the Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. What does git stash do?
git stash temporarily saves (or “stashes”) your uncommitted changes in a safe area so you can switch branches or work on something else without losing your work.

2. What does git log show?
git log displays the history of commits in a repository, showing details like commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

3. What does git branch do?
git branch manages branches in a repository.
git branch → lists all branches
git branch <name> → creates a new branch
git branch -d <name> → deletes a branch

4. What does git checkout do?
git checkout is used to switch between branches or commits.
Examples:
git checkout main # switch to main branch
git checkout feature-login # switch to another branch
git checkout -b new-feature # create and switch to new branch

5. How to implement merging in git? 
Merging combines changes from one branch into another.
Typically, you merge a feature branch into the main branch.
Example:
git checkout main
git merge feature-login

6. Diff. between merge and rebase?
Merge combines two branches by creating a new “merge commit” that preserves the complete history of both branches. 
Rebase, on the other hand, moves or reapplies commits from one branch on top of another, creating a cleaner and linear commit history. 
Merge is preferred for shared branches, while rebase is often used to tidy up local work before merging.

7. What is .gitignore used for? 
.gitignore tells Git which files or folders to ignore — i.e., not to track or commit.
